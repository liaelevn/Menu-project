# Menu-project
# 'The Pink Cafe'

I decided to create an affordable brunch/lunch Cafe menu based on the current cost of living crisis and also because I am a foodie that enjoys cooking and ordering food. I wanted to create a project that involved customer input functionality to mimic an actual customer ordering online as an end user, but also something affordable due to the cost of living. Once selecting an item from the menu, the 'lucky' customer would receive a Bacon and Egg burger that Pink Cafe were giving out and also receive a 10% discount off their whole order. The discount would only apply to the 10 random 'lucky' customers. The 'burger' is actually an API and when the API is called via Github, I will receive notifications and be able to view metrics on specific data for monitoring and security of my project on my Grafana server using a Github API. After the customer entered their contact details, a code would be generated for the customer to give to the delivery driver once their meal had been delivered, written in Unicode.

# Unit test

I wanted to branch out some of the skills I learnt during my time within the software testing bootcamp and do something different, such as using Python unit testing within this project as I understand the importance of unit testing to find errors and bugs as soon as possible, before releasing project for production.
