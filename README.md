# 'The Pink Cafe'

I decided to create a brunch/lunch Cafe menu as I am a foodie that enjoys cooking and ordering food. I wanted to create a project that involved customer input functionality to mimic an actual customer ordering online as an end user, once selecting an item from the menu, the 'lucky' customer would receive a Bacon and Egg burger that Pink Cafe were giving out and also receive a 10% discount off their whole order. The discount would only apply to the 10 random 'lucky' customers. The 'burger' is actually an API and when the API is called via Github, I will receive notifications and be able to view metrics on specific data for monitoring and security of my project. After the customer entered their contact details, a code would be generated for the customer to give to the delivery driver once their meal had been delivered, written in binary.
